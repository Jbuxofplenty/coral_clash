Turn Overview

The yellow player goes first, after which players alternate turns.

Each turn the active player moves one of their pieces resolving any Capture, Hunter Effects, or Gather Effects as a result of the movement. Note, you can Capture and Hunter in the same turn (or Capture and Gather).

After movement is completed, the active player checks if any of the Objectives have been met.

Move a piece

Follow the steps for moving a specific piece as defined below. Pieces cannot move through other pieces.

**Whale:** Can do one of the two moves below. The Whale may never end it's movement in check, where it could be captured, however the Whale can move through a threatened square:

Move half the piece any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Rotate half of the piece to one square vertically or horizontally.

or

Example of a Whale moving through a threatened square

**Dolphin:** Moves any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

**Turtle:** Moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.

**Pufferfish:** Moves any number of squares diagonally.

**Octopus:** Moves one square diagonally.

**Crab:** Moves one square vertically or horizontally.

**Capture:** A piece captures an opponent's piece by moving to the square occupied by the enemy piece. Whales can capture two pieces with the same movement.

**Hunter Movement:** When pieces that do not have the four coral icons move to a square with Coral, the movement ends. Whales that are already on Coral with half of the piece are not stopped when the other half of the piece moves onto the same Coral.

**Hunter Effect:** When pieces that do not have the four coral icons move to a square with Coral, the piece can remove the Coral from the square. Whales can remove two Coral in the same move (or just one Coral if the Whale is in on two Coral).

**Gatherer Effect:** When pieces that have the four coral icons move to a square without Coral, the piece can place Coral on the square.
